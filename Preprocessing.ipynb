    "### About The Data\n",
    "- EDA will be conducted on the description columns \n",
    "- The dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/bbc-news?select=bbc_news.csv.\n",
    "- The motivation behind the dataset is to produce a machine learning model that can prdict the topic of a new article. \n",
    "- data is captured from the BBC website.\n",
    "- The text preprocessing step will mainly analyze the \"description\" column and prep it for the ML analysis. This means we will attept to clean the text as much as possible.\n",
    "- Common text preprocessing step includes: \n",
    "    - Lower casing:\n",
    "        - The idea is to convert all the text into the same casing format. For example the inputs of 'hi', 'Hi', and 'HI' will all be treated the same way.\n",
    "        - This is helpful when conducting non-sentiment analysis. However, it could have a slight negative impact for ML models that require the proper casing of the words. E.g., Sentiment Analysis that expects that if a word contians all upper casing characters it represents anger.\n",
    "        - For this project we did not perfrom lower casing because, we are conducting a sentiment analysis.\n",
    "    - Removing any URLs & Emails & HTML tags\n",
    "        - Removal of URL, Emails, and HTML Tags\n",
    "        - The data did not contain any emails. Therefore, np emails were removed \n",
    "    - Punctuations Removal:\n",
    "        - The idea is to remove punctuations the from text data. Therefore, the same text data can be treated the same way even if some have punctuations and others do not. For example \"Yo\" and \"Yo!!!\" will  be treated the same way.\n",
    "        - Also, this step includes Removal of Non-alpha characters\n",
    "        - The most important point in punctuations analysis is the selection of symbols to remove.   \n",
    "    - Stop Words Removal:\n",
    "        - The idea is to remove all the words that commonly occur in the language. E.g., \"a\", \"so\", etc.\n",
    "    - Frequest Words Removal:\n",
    "        - The idea is to remove all the words that commonly occur for specfic type document or text.\n",
    "        - For this project we did not perfrom frequent words removal, because TF-IDF will be taking care of this step.\n",
    "    - Rare Words Removal:\n",
    "        - The idea is to remove all the words that barely occur in text.\n",
    "        - For this project we did not perfrom rare words removal, because TF-IDF will be taking care of this step.\n",
    "    - Stemming:\n",
    "        - The process of reducing inflected words to their word stem by removing the word's suffix and prefix. E.g., converting \"walking\" and \"walks\" to \"walk\". Stemming helps to imporve the computational time\n",
    "        - In this project we did not perform Stemming instead we performed Lemmatization, because Stemming can produce non proper english words.\n",
    "    - Lemmatization:\n",
    "        - Similar to stemming but it does not remove the words' suffix and prefix. It transfom words to their original root word which is called lemma. E.g., converting \"went\" and \"going\" to \"go\". Help to imporve the computational time\n",
    "        - This helps save unnecessary computational overhead in trying to decipher entire words since the meanings of most words are well-expressed by their separate lemmas.\n",
    "    - Emojis Removal/Transformation:\n",
    "        - Removing Emojis from text.\n",
    "        - This task was not conducted in this project.\n",
    "        - ðŸ˜€ is an emoji\n",
    "        - Note: in case of a sentement analysis like the analysis, it is prefered that Emojis are translated to words instead of them being removed.  \n",
    "    - Emoticons Removal/Transformation:\n",
    "        - Removing Emoticons from text.\n",
    "        - This task was not conducted in this project.\n",
    "        - From Grammarist.com, emoticon is built from keyboard characters that when put together in a certain way represent a facial expression, an emoji is an actual image.\n",
    "        - :-) is an emoticon\n",
    "        - Note: in case of a sentement analysis ot is prefered that Emoticons are translated to words instead of them being removed.   \n",
    "    - Chatwords Transformation :\n",
    "        - Transforming common chatwords such as BRB to \"Be Right Back\".\n",
    "        - This task was not conducted in this project.\n",
    "    - Spelling Checking:\n",
    "        - Checking the spelling of the data.\n",
