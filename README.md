<h1>
    NLP Topic Modeling Project For Clusting BBC News Articles</h1>
</div>

<div>
<h2>General Information About The Project: </h2>
</div>
<div>
<ul>

<li>The project is written in Python in a Jupyter Notebook format</li>
<li>The motivation behind the dataset is to produce a machine learning model that can categorize news articles on their specifc Topic </li>
<li>The work is to break down the data into 5 categories (i.e., K = 5). Based on the each category's keywords we have interpreted their meaning</li>
<li>The dataset behind the project is available from kaggle.com <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/bbc-news?select=bbc_news.csv"> Dataset Link
</a>
<li>The purpose of the dataset is to cluster articles based on their specifc topic and compare LDA vs. NFM</li>

<li>The project initially starts by conducting EDA in preprocessing.ipynb file</li>
<li>The second part of the project conducts the unsupervised ML analysis in maincode.ipynb </li>





</ul>

<h2>EDA Conclusions Written Information: </h2>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There are <b>5</b> features however this analysis focuses on only two which are: </li>
<ul>
<li><b>title</b>, the real title of a news article</li>
<li><b>description</b>, the text of the news article </li>

</ul>



</ul>

</div>

<h2>Conclusions: </h2>

<ul>
<li>      LDA and NFM were applied on BBC news articles of March 2023 to June 2023
</li>

<li>
    A K of 5 was selected for both Topic Modeling algorithms
</li>

<li>
    NFM seemed to have an issue with one of the topics by have various repeated words which could be an indicator for selecting a too large of a K value
</li>
<li>
    Topics of both algorithms covered: European Soccer, International Soccer, Internal Politics of the U.K, and The Ukrainian War. All of which are topics that are very relevant during this work
</li>

<li>
    A future improvement to the work is to conduct Coherence Analysis of various K values then selecting the value that produced the highest K
